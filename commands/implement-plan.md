description: Implement the plan given by the user
model: sonnet

The user has given you either a session (in this case, read the `plan.md` contained
in the session's folder, check conventions) or a `plan.md` file. This file
describes a concrete plan that the user and the agent agreed on which 
contains context and a description for a change to the project.

First, analyze this plan carefully and derive a ToDo-List for this to structure your work.
If there are any open questions regarding the implementation, feel free to ask the user.
Once clear on the deatils, begin following this plan.

Use the running to-do list to inform the user about your progress. During your
implementation, briefly send messages to the user highlighting where you are in the plan.
