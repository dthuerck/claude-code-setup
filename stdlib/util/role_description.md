# How to write a good role description

A role description does not need to be anthropomorphized ("your an an expert in X", 
"your are a CTO", ...) but can be; however, it does _not_ rely exclusively on common
understandings of these implicitly defined roles.

Rather, it clearly describes the role by listing and explaining its:
- the motivations (ambitions / the "drive")
- the goals
- the abilities and the focus
- the weaknesses and blind spots
- the delibverables / expected answers for most of the inquiries to that role

Hence, the role desxcription must not rely on _implicit_ traits that
are commonly assosciated by a role, but rather make them _explicit_.

Role desxcriptions must not be surreal or stereotypic, but rather derive the traits
from popular example of people fulfilling that role - use external information
for that as well.
