# Codebase Discovery Methodology for Targeted Question Answering

## Core Philosophy
Operate on the principle of **"surgical precision over exhaustive exploration"**: the goal is to answer the specific question accurately without getting lost in the codebase maze.

## Methodology: The SCOUT Framework

### **S**can - High-level reconnaissance
### **C**ontext - Build mental model
### **O**rient - Follow the breadcrumbs
### **U**nderstand - Deep dive on targets
### **T**est - Validate understanding

## Step-by-Step Approach

### Phase 1: Initial Reconnaissance (2-3 minutes)
```bash
# Get project structure overview
find . -type f -name "*.json" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.toml" | grep -E "(package|cargo|pyproject|go\.mod|pom\.xml|build)" | head -20

# Identify tech stack quickly
ls -la | head -20
find . -maxdepth 2 -type f \( -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.go" -o -name "*.java" -o -name "*.rs" \) | head -5

# Check for documentation
find . -type f -name "README*" -o -name "*.md" | grep -v node_modules | head -10

# Look for configuration and setup files
find . -maxdepth 3 -name "*config*" -o -name "*.env*" | head -10
```

### Phase 2: Targeted Search Based on Question Type

#### For "How is X implemented?" questions:
```bash
# Start with exact matches
grep -r "class X\|function X\|def X\|const X" --include="*.{js,py,go,java,rs,cpp,ts}" . 2>/dev/null | head -20

# Find imports/usage of X
grep -r "import.*X\|from.*X\|require.*X" --include="*.{js,py,go,java,rs,cpp,ts}" . 2>/dev/null | head -20

# Look for files named after X
find . -name "*X*" -type f | grep -v node_modules | grep -v ".git" | head -20

# Context around X (show 3 lines before and after)
grep -B3 -A3 "X" --include="*.{js,py,go,java,rs,cpp,ts}" . 2>/dev/null | head -50
```

#### For "What library is used for Z?" questions:
```bash
# Check dependency files based on language
cat package.json 2>/dev/null | grep -A2 -B2 "dependencies"
cat requirements.txt 2>/dev/null
cat go.mod 2>/dev/null | grep -v "^go "
cat Cargo.toml 2>/dev/null | grep -A10 "dependencies"
cat pom.xml 2>/dev/null | grep -A2 "dependency"

# Search for import statements related to Z functionality
grep -r "import.*Z\|require.*Z" --include="*.{js,py,go,java,rs,cpp,ts}" . | head -20
```

#### For "What would we need to implement Y?" questions:
```bash
# Find similar existing implementations
grep -r "class.*Controller\|class.*Service\|class.*Handler" --include="*.{js,py,go,java,rs,cpp,ts}" . | head -10

# Identify patterns and interfaces
find . -name "*interface*" -o -name "*abstract*" -o -name "*base*" | head -20

# Look at test files for examples
find . -name "*test*" -o -name "*spec*" | grep -i "Y" | head -10
```

### Phase 3: Deep Dive Tools

```bash
# Count lines and complexity of specific file
wc -l <filename>

# See file structure without opening
head -50 <filename>
tail -50 <filename>

# Get function/class definitions in a file
grep -n "^class \|^def \|^function \|^const " <filename>

# Find all references to a specific term
grep -rn "specific_term" . --include="*.{js,py,go,java,rs,cpp,ts}" | wc -l

# Trace call hierarchy (simple version)
grep -r "function_name(" . --include="*.{js,py,go,java,rs,cpp,ts}" | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq
```

## Principles for Scope Control

### 1. **The 3-Hop Rule**
Never go more than 3 files deep from your starting point without reassessing. If you're following imports: File A → imports B → imports C → STOP and verify you're still on track.

### 2. **Time-box Each Phase**
- Initial scan: 2-3 minutes max
- Targeted search: 5 minutes max
- Deep dive: 10 minutes max per specific component

### 3. **Ignore Noise Directories**
Always exclude these unless specifically relevant:
```bash
--exclude-dir={node_modules,.git,dist,build,vendor,target,.venv,__pycache__}
```

### 4. **Start Narrow, Expand Cautiously**
Begin searches with:
- Exact term matches
- Specific file extensions
- Limited directory depth (`-maxdepth 2`)

Only broaden if initial searches yield nothing.

### 5. **The Hypothesis-First Approach**
Before diving deep, form a hypothesis:
- "This is probably in the `/src/services/` directory"
- "This likely follows the XYZ pattern I saw in other files"
- "The configuration is probably in `/config/` or at the root"

Test the hypothesis quickly before exploring broadly.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Reading Every File** - You're not here to understand everything
2. **Following Every Import** - Stay focused on the question
3. **Ignoring Naming Conventions** - Projects usually have patterns
4. **Skipping the Documentation** - README files often have crucial architecture info
5. **Not Using File Names as Clues** - `userAuthentication.js` probably handles... user authentication

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Is it a "WHERE" question?
├─ Yes → Use find and grep with specific terms
└─ No → Continue

Is it a "HOW" question?
├─ Yes → Find the implementation, then trace 1-2 levels of dependencies
└─ No → Continue

Is it a "WHAT LIBRARY" question?
├─ Yes → Check package managers first, then imports
└─ No → Continue

Is it a "WHAT'S NEEDED" question?
├─ Yes → Find similar implementations as templates
└─ No → Apply general search strategy
```

## Example Workflow

**Question**: "How is user authentication implemented?"

```bash
# 1. Quick scan for auth-related files
find . -name "*auth*" -type f | grep -v node_modules | head -10

# 2. Look for common auth patterns
grep -r "login\|authenticate\|jwt\|session" --include="*.{js,py}" . | head -20

# 3. Check middleware/interceptors
find . -name "*middleware*" -o -name "*interceptor*" | head -10

# 4. Once found, examine the specific file
grep -n "^class \|^def \|^function " auth_service.py

# 5. Find where it's used
grep -r "AuthService\|auth_service" --include="*.py" . | head -10
```

This methodology emphasizes **speed, focus, and pragmatism** - exactly what you need when dropped into an unfamiliar codebase with a specific question to answer.
